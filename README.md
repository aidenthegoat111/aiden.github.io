## Changes made from miro

- I changed the website from one page to multiple pages because I thought that it was too much content to fit into one long page.
I also thought that it would look more organised. the buttons still work and direct users to the accurate page, but instead of being
all in one page, I split it into 3 different pages.
- I didn't implement the scroll wheel feature because I didn't think there was a need for it. Scrolling down with the mousepad was much
smoother when testing the website out.
