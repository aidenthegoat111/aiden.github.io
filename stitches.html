    <h2>Details about my stitches on my finger.</h2>

    <div class="content">
      This was my most recent injury.
      It happened when during a wushu performance in school where someone sliced a knife deep into my skin.
      I was then rushed to the ER in the hospital to get my finger stitched up.
      I was very lucky to be rushed to get stitches because I would have a very high risk of infecting the wound the longer the finger goes without treatment.

      The photo above was the finger before the stitches.
      The stitching process didn't hurt as much as I thought.
      Though the anesthesia injection hurt the most.
      When the doctor was stitching my finger together, I could not feel anything and was encouraged not to look as it was described as "disgusting".

      The recovery for this injury was quite smooth, 
      there was not much to do but to sit at home and let it rest on a table.
      There was nothing to do except to let it breathe a bit at home before bandaging it up again.
      The doctor allowed me to continue playing football, but there would be a risk of injuring and infecting the wound even more.
      I ended up playing football 2 days after getting my finger stitched up and was lucky that nothing bad happened.
