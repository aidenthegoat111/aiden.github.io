    <h2>Details about my sprained ankle injuries.</h2>

    <div class="content">
      Sprained ankles are very common in sports.
      It occurs when an ankle lands on the floor at an awkward angle.
      These sprains can result in ligaments being torn apart.
      There are different grades to ankle sprains, from 0-3.
      Luckily, my ankle sprains are often grade 1, which is not severe.
      However, recently, Kelley has got a grade 2 ankle sprain,
      which is quite severe and takes quite a long time to recover.

      Less severe ankle sprains will often heal itself,
      and therefore does not need any treatment.
      However, if the pain is too much to handle,
      putting ice will relieve the stress on the foot.
      The numbness after icing it for a while will help the foot feel better.
      Putting your foot in a bucket of cold water with ice will work better as the it will make the whole foot feel numb,
      thus making the whole foot feel less painful.

      For more severe ankle sprains,
      physical therapy can be helpful.
      Professional physios will have machines specifically for dealing with these kinds of injuries.
      They may also give you exercises to do at home to speed up the recovery process.
      For very severe ankle sprains,
      MRI and X-rays scans are needed for doctors to have a better understanding of your injury.
      Very severe injuries can often result in operations in the foot to stitch or move ligaments back together.
      I am very lucky to not have experienced severe ankle sprains.
