    <h2>Details about my Meniscus Tear injury.</h2>

    <div class="content">
        A meniscus tear is an injury caused by forcefully twisting or rotating your knee.
        A lot of rehab and physio is needed to recover from this injury, but I was fortunate enough to have surgery on my knee to speed up my recovery.
        There are many surgery procedures for meniscus tears, but I chose the most reliable procedure, a meniscus repair.
        However, instead of stitching the meniscus back together, I had it stapled together as it would recover faster.
        After a bit over two weeks, it was taken out and I needed crutches to move around.
